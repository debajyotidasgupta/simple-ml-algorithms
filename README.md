# simple-ml-algorithms
Hands-on understanding of core ML Algorithms, simple implementations.

Simple implementations of core Machine Learning algorithms in Python. These algorithms are implemented from scratch, without using any libraries like `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, etc. The purpose of this repository is to understand the core concepts of these algorithms by implementing them from scratch.
